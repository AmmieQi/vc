    Similar LSTM layer to the `LSTMLayer` in Caffe
    ----
    Args:
        seq_bottom : the underlying sequence input of size [T, N, D_in], where
            D_in is the input dimension, T is num_steps and N is batch_size.
        const_bottom : the constant bottom concatenated to each time step,
            having shape [N, D_const]. This can be *None*. If it is None,
            then this input is ignored.
        output_dim : the number of hidden units in the LSTM unit and also the
            final output dimension, i.e. D_out.
        num_layers : the number of stacked LSTM layers.
        forget_bias : forget gate bias in LSTM unit.
        apply_dropout, keep_prob: dropout applied to the output of each LSTM
            unit.
        concat_output : if True, concatenate the ouputs (as is done in Caffe)
        sequence_length : (Optional) Tensor of size [N], contains length of each
                          sequence.
